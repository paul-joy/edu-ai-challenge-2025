Analyze a given set of project requirements to select a database for a new application:
- Social platform with millions of users;
- Need to store profiles, posts, and connections between users;
- High data read speed required;
- Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations;
- Scalability is important as the user base grows.

Select and justify the most suitable type of database for the project. Use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning (should be step-by-step and well-structured) by mimicking how humans often solve complex problems. Show how the decision was made based on the requirements.
